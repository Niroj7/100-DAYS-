"""This is a simple Python script that asks the user for a location (like a university or landmark), then contacts an OpenGeo API to get geographic data. From the response, it extracts and prints the plus_code, which is a short, digital address based on the location.

The program uses Python’s built-in urllib and json libraries to:

Send a request to the API with the given location

Parse the returned JSON

Pull out the plus_code from the first result

Display the final plus code in the console

It’s a great beginner-friendly example for learning how to work with web APIs and JSON in Python.
